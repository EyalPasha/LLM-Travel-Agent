## 🔍 **Deep Dive: How It Works**

### 🎯 **Intent Detection System**

Sofia uses sophisticated pattern matching to identify user intent:

```python
intent_patterns = {
    "destination_inquiry": [
        r"where should I (go|visit|travel)",
        r"recommend.*destination",
        r"best place.*(for|to)",
        r"suggest.*trip"
    ],
    "weather_check": [
        r"weather.*in",
        r"how.*weather",
        r"temperature.*in"
    ]
    # ... 5 more intent types
}
```

### 🧵 **Conversation Flow Management**

```python
# Conversation states automatically transition:
GREETING → PLANNING → DETAILS → BOOKING → FOLLOW_UP

# Context accumulates across turns:
session.context.current_destination = "Japan"
session.context.interests.append("photography")
session.context.travel_profile["archetype"] = "Explorer"
```

### 🔄 **Adaptive Prompt Construction**

```python
def build_prompt_chain(self, session, user_message):
    if self._is_simple_query(user_message):
        return self._build_simple_prompt(user_message)
    else:
        return (
            self._build_system_prompt() +
            self._build_context_prompt(session) + 
            self._build_reasoning_prompt()
        )
```
