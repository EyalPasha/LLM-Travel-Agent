To help me recommend the perfect place for you, what kind of experience are you most drawn to? Are you looking for:
- Cultural immersion with cities and history
- Natural adventures and stunning landscapes
- Beach relaxation and tropical vibes
- Food and culinary experiences
- Something more active like hiking or outdoor adventures

For example, if you're looking for a bit of everything with great infrastructure for solo travelers, Portugal is fantastic - it's affordable, has beautiful cities like Lisbon and Porto, delicious food, and is very safe for solo exploration. Or if you dream of mountains and nature, places like New Zealand or Norway offer incredible landscapes with well-marked trails.

What sounds most appealing to you?"""
