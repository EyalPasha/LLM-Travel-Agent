# Brief Notes on Key Prompt Engineering Decisions

## Core Design Choices

### 1. **Adaptive Complexity**

**Decision**: Use different prompt sophistication based on query type.

- Simple queries (weather): Concise prompts, direct answers
- Complex queries (multi-constraint planning): Full reasoning framework
- **Why**: Prevents over-engineering simple requests while maintaining sophistication for complex needs

### 2. **Psychological Traveler Profiling**

**Decision**: Integrate traveler archetypes into system prompts.

- Explorer, Comfort Seeker, Culture Enthusiast, Budget Traveler
- **Why**: Personalizes responses and recommendation style to match user preferences

### 3. **Chain of Thought for Complex Queries**

**Decision**: Explicit reasoning steps for multi-factor travel decisions.

- UNDERSTAND → ANALYZE → SYNTHESIZE → RECOMMEND → ANTICIPATE
- **Why**: Ensures thoughtful, well-reasoned responses rather than superficial suggestions

### 4. **Context-Aware Prompt Building**

**Decision**: Dynamically construct prompts using conversation history.

- Previous destinations, stated preferences, travel profile
- **Why**: Enables coherent multi-turn conversations where responses build meaningfully

### 5. **Quality Guidelines Embedded in Prompts**

**Decision**: Include explicit response quality criteria in system prompts.

- Weather responses: 2-3 sentences max
- Actionable advice, practical next steps
- **Why**: Prevents verbosity and ensures consistent, helpful outputs

### 6. **Intent-Based Prompt Routing**

**Decision**: Route to specialized prompt templates based on detected intent.

- Weather queries → data-focused prompts
- Cultural queries → educational prompts  
- Planning queries → recommendation prompts
- **Why**: Each intent gets optimally structured prompts vs one-size-fits-all

## Technical Implementation

### Parameter Tuning

- Factual queries: Temperature 0.3 (deterministic)
- Creative recommendations: Temperature 0.7 (balanced)
- Prompt length: 1000-1500 tokens (efficiency vs sophistication)

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation prompts for API failures
- Clarification requests for unclear queries
- Built-in hallucination detection patterns

## Results (from test file)

- **Overall Score**: 98/100 (A+ grade)
- **Prompt Engineering**: 100/100 (Perfect)
- Successfully handles 7 travel query types with personalized, context-aware responses
